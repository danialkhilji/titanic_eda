# titanic_eda
Exploratory data analysis of titnanic dataset. There are numerous datasets on the internet on titanic data but the most famous is this one: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic. I have used a similar dataset but with less number of columns (data features) in the titanic.csv file.
The titanic_eda.ipynb is the jupyter notebook where all the analysis is carried out. The Titanic data report is an html file. You need to open it in any browser. The html file shows a general overview of the dataset generated using sweetviz library (automatic EDA package).
